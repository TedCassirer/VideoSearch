    "description": "Not long after we started double dating together in 2008, we received an email from two 16-year-old guys who were in need of dating advice.  Since we sometimes get date requests from girls who are definitely too young for us, we figured, \"why not train these kids to be our proteges, so they can handle the younger girls?\"\n\nThe original video they recreated at 4:03 is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsXWqwTr2rM\n\nFor more pickup and dating videos, subscribe to our channel: http://youtube.com/daveandethan\n\nLike/Follow us on:\nFACEBOOK: http://facebook.com/daveandethan\nTWITTER: http://twitter.com/daveandethan",
