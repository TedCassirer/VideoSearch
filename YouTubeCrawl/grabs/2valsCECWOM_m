    "description": "Just bought the DVD of \"Surf's Up\" since I liked the film of course but wanted to try a video with it. Used another Boy Hits Car song. I thought this song fit well for surfing. Listening to the lyrics the video is about Cody being Lani's savior and helping her reconnect with her uncle.\r\n\r\n\"Surf's Up\" is property of Sony Pictures Animation.",
