    "description": "I saw The Little Mermaid on Broadway a while ago and it was AMAZING! I can't even begin to describe how wonderful it was. Little Mermaid is one of my favorite Disney movies and to see it on Broadway was a fantastic experience for me. One of the new songs for The Little Mermaid musical is called \"Beyond My Wildest Dreams\" and once I heard it I wanted to do a video to it. So here it is! I hope you enjoy the song and the video. Sirra Boggess (Played Ariel) has a beautiful voice! \r\n\r\nThanks and enjoy!",
