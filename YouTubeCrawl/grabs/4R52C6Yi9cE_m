    "description": "As the weeks of training continue, we find that it's the little things that are the big challenges.   She's great on sidewalks, around furniture, but those curbs take some work!\n\nShe's getting 30 minutes with the trainers every other day.  On off days, the family runs her through exercises and just takes her for walks in her cart.\n\nShe does one header in the video, but don't worry, she wasn't hurt at all.\n\nBut she will be wearing her pink crash helmet next time :-)\n\nPrincess Daisy Online Store\nhttp://www.cafepress.com/princessdaisy/\n\nPrincess Daisy is a PROS Pug Rescue dog\nhttp://www.pugpros.org/",
