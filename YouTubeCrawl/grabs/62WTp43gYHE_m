    "description": "This IS my horse!\r\n\r\nThis is NOT http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHWGzJjQDwo \r\n\r\nJasper is a 16hh 6yr old bay gelding. I have had jasper since June and bought him off a friend (had to sell him due to a relationship break down) and in the summer just did alot of hacking, beach rides, a riding holiday (not with myself but a complete novice) and was as good as gold. 100% hacking, alone or in company and goes 1st or last.\r\n\r\nHe is happy to pop over a log/ditch out hacking and we really enjoy cantering through the big puddles in the feild. \r\n\r\nJasper has been working nicely in the school and begining to round up very nicely, leg yeilding and shoulder fore established.\r\n\r\nJasper has a very bold jump and is loose jumping at approx 4'6 upright and 4ftx3'3ft ascending spread with scope to burn (see video). Under saddle i have done some poles, small grids, fillers, planks,small course of fences nothing really seems to phase him.\r\n\r\nI feel i have to sell him because i can't give him enough attention due to uni, a job and my other horse, he should be out having a career or at least a home where he can get all the attention he deserves.",
