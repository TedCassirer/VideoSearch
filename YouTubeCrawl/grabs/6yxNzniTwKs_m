    "description": "Here is Jimmy Fingers' Harbin/Gwynne walkaway suspension, custom built by Jimmy, computer designed and improved over 6 different versions.  The video is over ten years old, and he no longer uses the single Blaney hoop...  the improved handling features two giant hoops that are rolled out into the audience upon completion of the effect.  This is one of the cleanest, most effective, angle proof versions of this illusion.  This video was shot in Las Vegas while Jimmy was substituting for Mac King in his famous afternoon show.",
