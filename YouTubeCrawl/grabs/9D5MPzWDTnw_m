    "description": "Kylie's POV\r\nI woke up Sunday morning thinking today is all about me and Nick. No studio time, no lessons, no work, and no school. I finished up the remainder of my school work due for three weeks. Lets just say it took a couple of all nighters, but now that im way ahead of schedule, I dont have to worry about it getting in my way. I took a shower and straightened my hair as usual. I popped in my contacts and went downstairs to see Nolie and Kevin eating breakfast. He came and gave me a huge hug. I smiled at him and hugged him back. I kissed Nolie on the cheek and grabbed some juice. I noticed how much happier she was with Kevin. I was glad, she deserved every bit of happiness she gets. \"Hey Nolie i think im heading over to Nick's, we're probably going to spend the day together so you wouldn't need me to do anything do you?\" She smiled sweetly at me. \"No sweetie you go ahead, you've done plenty lately. Wanna ride?\" \"Nah\" I said, \"I wanna walk to think about things.\" She and Kevin were looking at eachother while she was saying this, \"Alright well call me if you need anything\". I put my glass in the sink and replied, \"Will do buckaroo!\". I ran upstairs to get ready to go to Nicks. Charm bracelet? Check. I found a royal blue Paramore t-shirt and threw it on. I got my light faded jeans and my converse and BAM! I was done. I grabbed a plain white zip up hoodie and headed out the door. I popped in my ipod and started thinking about what i had prepared for Nick. I wonder if he would like it...It was a cool Sunday morning and all i could think about was seeing Nick again. When I got there Mrs. Jonas welcomed me with a big hug and we chatted for awhile. \"Oh! Mrs. Jonas I almost forgot, i got a book the other day that is AMAZING, so i brought it and figured maybe you'd like it? It's really sappy, but good nonetheless =D\" She smiled graciously and took the book. We talked more about who knows what. When Joe came in from his jog. \r\n\"HEY!! How's my little buddy doin!\"\r\n\"Haha im doing good Joe, hows Dems\" I said matter-a-factly to him. He blushed and rufffeled my hair as he went to grab an apple. \r\n\"I'll let you know after tonight\" He winked. I shrieked a little. Considering it was still only 8 o'clock on a Sunday morning Nick was still asleep. I decided to cook breakfast with Mrs. Jonas first then go and wake him up. After we finished cooking, Mrs. Jonas and Mr. Jonas went grocery shopping. Joe took Frankie to the park with Demi. I ran upstairs since it was almost nine now and went slowly into Nicks room. I stood there for awhile smiling to myself. He looked adorable. Like an angel in deep slumber. Too bad I have to ruin that. I smiled sneakily and slowly tip-toed over to his bed and....just as i was about to take his covers off... \"BOO!!\" He screamed sitting up scaring the living crap out of me. \"AHHHHHH!\" I screamed completely startled. I fell backwards and started laughing really hard. In between laughs I finally managed, \"Your...going..to..hahahaha...pay ...joonnaass!!!!\" He jumped down on top of me and started tickling me. \"You thought you were gonna get me huh? Well always two steps ahead of the game baby!!!\" he taunted me as i was losing breath from laughing. \"OKAY OKAY OKAY!\" He finally stopped and I regained my composure. He was still sitting on me like a triumphant little kid. He leaned down so our noses were touching and whispered \"I missed you\". I could smell his amazing scent. He leaned in to kiss me lightly but I got up on my elbows knocking him back a little. I laughed and said, \"Brush your teeth first 'oh mighty one', i made breakfast downstairs\". With that said i got him off of me and walked downstairs leaving a bewildered Nick in his room. \r\n\r\nthree parts to this one! =D\r\ncomments please!
