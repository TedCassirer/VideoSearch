    "description": "READ THIS BOX BEFORE YOU POST....PARTICULARLY ELITIST GUITARIST DUMBASSES!!\r\n\r\nOkay, now that I have your attention with some ridiculous \"e-yelling\" or whatever they call it these days, I think it's time I explain this video because some dolts don't seem to grasp the fucking concept of what this video was all about.\r\n\r\nIn all my years as a guitarist, I've heard of the Jaguar and Jazzmaster being touted as a \"surf\" or \"punk\" or \"grunge\" or \"post-punk\" guitar.  Personally, I'm sick of hearing about \"this guitar goes with this genre, and that guitar goes with that genre\"...hence the \"it ain't your daddy's surf guitar\" or whatever that's in the stupidly long and redaundant title.  I was pissed off that day at a bunch of alternative elitist fucktards who felt the need to bash me because I play 80's influenced rock on a 60's style guitar.  To me, the Jaguar is good for more than just strumming jangly chords and writing about boring buearucratic politics.\r\n\r\nMany have bitched about my comment that \"I follow no one\", there's a reason I said that here, it applies to the CONTEXT of which the video was a statement about.  Does Edward Van-Halen play a Jaguar? NO!  Does Steve Vai-Play a Jazzmaster, NO!  Does Yngwie Malmsteen shred it up on a Duo-Sonic...I don't think so.  The point was not original in the context of style, but CHOICE OF INSTRUMENT.  Apparently too many of you are too daft to figure that one out.\r\n\r\nAs for my tapping sucking, well, let's see here, I was not playing regularly, I made this video SPUR OF THE MOMENT and in a very bad mood, like a shoot you and fuck your girlfriend kind of mood.  Yes, I take my guitar work VERY seriously, because it's a huge part of me.  Some of you \"I want to play guitar to fuck and get famous\" people might not understand that, while those are great and honorable goals, it's not the reason I do this.\r\n\r\nWhy do I do it, because it's fun, and I like the sound of my own playing, and apparently, a lot of other people do too, so if you have a problem with my vids, or my guitar work, or my choice of axe, choice of amp, or whatever... you can go away, or GO FUCK YOURSELF, since that's probably all you do anyway.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, I'm done with being nice about this, I'm done with being classy, it's a shame it had to go this far, but I'm fed up with answering the same 3-5 bullshit flames every 2 weeks on this stupid little video I made spur of the moment which I had no idea a lot of people would even pay attention to.",
