    "description": "Artist: (unknown) mixed by DJ Keoki \r\nSong: Bonny Doon\r\nAlbum: All Mixed Up\r\nDescription: I was in the mood to upload some keokie classics, my favorite old school dj who's sad story of being the #1 superstar DJ to ending up in the dumps was disappointing. Yet in the time of his peak keoki def release some bitchin' tracks ,my favorite album was 'All Mixed Up.' So this song is one that leads to that killer mix that still is untouched. A very trancy and vocal physcodelic track.  \r\n\r\nBringing you the old school classics from the time the scene was alive and techno ruled the underground. For those old school techno listeners to cherish and the new school to experience.  \r\n\r\n(Mainly tracks from:  94' - 1999 era.)\r\n\r\n(Message me for more info.)",
