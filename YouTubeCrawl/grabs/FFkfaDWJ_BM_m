    "description": "This week we visit Anastazia Lousie of Bad Unkl Sista and the Carpet Bag Brigade for a special Janome Spotlight: Designer Dreamspace and take a look at an awesome event she participated in in San Francisco called 2nd Skin. Corinne makes the shrug bolero wrap thingy she was wearing in last week's episode because so many of you liked it and we get a sweet viewer transmission. Also, a shout out to ajackson_2010 for the cool shirt she made and don't forget to submit your videos to win a free Janome sewing machine!\n\nLinks in this episode:\nBad Unkl Sista - http://badunklsista.com/\nCarpet Bag Brigade - http://www.carpetbagbrigade.com/\nJanome - http://www.myspace.com/janome_america\n2nd Skin - http://www.exploratorium.edu/2ndskin/\nJanome Contest - http://www.threadbanger.com/page/janome-contest",
