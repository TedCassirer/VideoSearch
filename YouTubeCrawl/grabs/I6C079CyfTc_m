    "description": "www.egyptiangumbo.com\r\nThis is a beautiful  recitation by Sheikh Majid Al-'anzi From Masjid AlKabeer in Kuwait. Ramadan 1428. He is reciting from Surat Al-Kahf Ayat 13-20. \r\n\r\nInterpretation of the Meaning of the Ayat:\r\n\r\n13 We narrate unto you (O Muhammad SAW) their story with truth: Truly! They were young men who believed in their Lord (Allah), and We increased them in guidance.  \r\n14 And We made their hearts firm and strong (with the light of Faith in Allah and bestowed upon them patience to bear the separation of their kith and kin and dwellings, etc.) when they stood up and said: \"Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, never shall we call upon any ilah (god) other than Him; if we did, we should indeed have uttered an enormity in disbelief.  \r\n15 \"These our people have taken for worship aliha (gods) other than Him (Allah). Why do they not bring for them a clear authority? And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah.  \r\n16 (The young men said to one another): \"And when you withdraw from them, and that which they worship, except Allah, then seek refuge in the Cave, your Lord will open a way for you from His Mercy and will make easy for you your affair (i.e. will give you what you will need of provision, dwelling, etc.).\"  \r\n17 And you might have seen the sun, when it rose, declining to the right from their Cave, and when it set, turning away from them to the left, while they lay in the midst of the Cave. That is (one) of the Ayat (proofs, evidences, signs) of Allah. He whom Allah guides, is rightly guided; but he whom He sends astray, for him you will find no Walee (guiding friend) to lead him (to the right Path).  \r\n18 And you would have thought them awake, while they were asleep. And We turned them on their right and on their left sides, and their dog stretching forth his two forelegs at the entrance (of the Cave or in the space near to the entrance of the Cave (as a guard at the gate)). Had you looked at them, you would certainly have turned back from them in flight, and would certainly have been filled with awe of them.  \r\n19 Likewise, We awakened them (from their long deep sleep) that they might question one another. A speaker from among them said: \"How long have you stayed (here)?\" They said: \"We have stayed (perhaps) a day or part of a day.\" They said: \"Your Lord (Alone) knows best how long you have stayed (here). So send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the town, and let him find out which is the good lawful food, and bring some of that to you. And let him be careful and let no man know of you.  \r\n20 \"For if they come to know of you, they will stone you (to death or abuse and harm you) or turn you back to their religion, and in that case you will never be successful.\"",
