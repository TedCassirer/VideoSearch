    "title": "Bahar: The Joy of Lively Spring by Sugata Marjit",
    "description": "Sugata Marjit, a khyal singer with unique imaginations, chose raga Bahar at the 'Kolkata Aitijjhya' concert on 15 December 2007 at the Vivekananda Hall of Jadavpur University. The audience was enthralled with this brilliant rendering. The application of 'Shudh-Ga' sprinkled brilliant colors in the performance. Aurobindo Bhattacharya gave support on the tabla. You can also observe Dipankar [Mukherjee], who is basically a flautist, accompanied the vocalist nicely on the Harmonium. \r\n \r\nEnjoy the brilliant performance--",
