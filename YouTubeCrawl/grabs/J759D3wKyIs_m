    "description": "PLEASE RATE - COMMENT - FAVORITE AND SUBSCRIBE!\r\n\r\nA few different clips of Baby Sea Lions playing around on the Galapagos Islands.  The first one in the video was definitely my favorite one on the trip.  He clamped on to my pants a few times tugging like he wanted to play, and after that grabbed onto my backpack strap.  Since I didn't play with him (we weren't aloud to touch them :( ) he moved on, and ended up untying someone in our groups shoes!\r\n\r\nMore Galapagos Videos on this playlist: http://youtube.com/view_play_list?p=B750EB7B3E0DD8A3",
