    "description": "There is music and sounds throughout, although they're not constant.  There should be more, I guess.\r\n\r\nNovember, 2007 marked the 25th anniversary of the release of the Vectrex in my country.  This is a celebration of the system and some of it's games to date, NOT a comprehensive history or a who's who behind it, in case there's any question of \"why no mention of Jay Smith?\", since, when I say I thank everyone tied to it, I mean EVERYONE, from back in the day to Mark Shaker nowadays who makes PCBs for it.\r\n\r\nThe music near the end during the game list comes from Vecmania and the piece after that is from Vector 21.\r\n\r\nAnd, check out my all Vectrex wiki!\r\n\r\nhttp://vectrex.wikia.com/wiki/Vectrex_Wiki\r\n\r\nI also have a vector gaming forum too as well: http://vectorgaming.proboards.com/index.cgi",
