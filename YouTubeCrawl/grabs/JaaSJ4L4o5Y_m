    "description": "Originally by Cliff Burton (RIP)\r\n\r\nThis is only the start. The lighting is crap. The sound is really bad, as I don't actually have a bass amp, and I'm scared of turning my guitar amp up because it might blow. \r\n\r\nOther than that, and the bits were I screw up (especially the end), I think it's pretty good for about an hour spent on the piece.\r\n\r\nAlso, my bass is tuned to drop B (B F# B E), so it is out of tune compared to Cliff's version. I'm just too lazy to tune it back to standard.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!!",
