    "title": "Vincent Bell On His Funky Electric Sitar - Airport Love Theme",
    "description": "Airport: 1970...\n\nVincent Bell did the sountrack here for the movie \"Airport\".  This psychedelic (electric sitar) tune garnered Bell a Grammy nomination in 1970.  Henry Mancini won the award but Bell gained notable recognition for his unique musical talents.\n\nAirport (1970) was the first in a line of well known \"Airport\" disaster movies created by Irwin Allen.  This movie was produced by Ross Hunter.\n\nMy personal favorite is \"Airport 75\" with Karen Black.  Karen rocks!  : )",
