    "description": "Part 1 of 2\r\nThis is the movie of our Italy tour called \"CP goes Italy\". Our aim was to visit as many car-sightseeings as possible in a very short time. And I think that it worked :)\r\n\r\nOf course we had a lot of fun and we met some really cool guys, like Horracio Pagani (the founder of Pagani Automobili) or Fabio Lamborghini (the nephew of Ferrucio Lamborghini), seen many cars on street, like the Enzo, Aston Martins, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Maseratis etc and some very rare cars in the Collections. It was just a very nice trip and some of the best days in my life. A dream became true :-) Thank every participant for this great tour!\r\n\r\nDates:\r\n27.04. Ruf Automobile\r\n28.04.
