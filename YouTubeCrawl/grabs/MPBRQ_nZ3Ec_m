Remix Done by the famous Jellybean Benitez who was behind Madonna's first hits.\r\nthis track shows another one of the amazing Donna's Verstile vocals. Probably the most Versatile singer ever!\r\nEnjoy this Rock/Pop/New wave/Underground dance Gem from the 80's...:-)\r\n\r\nRight outside the window something's happening\r\nA man he stares into a TV screen\r\nFrom the next apartment we hear music\r\nBleeding through the scene\r\n\r\nTV pans the bedroom, woman's sleeping\r\nHands are sprawled out loosely across the bed\r\nShe must be pretty rich\r\n'Cause I can see all the diamonds on her neck\r\n\r\nChorus :\r\nAnd there's always someone watching\r\nEyes\r\nTV's and someone's watching\r\nEyes\r\nIn the kitchen someone's watching\r\nEyes\r\nAnd the maid and butler's watching\r\nEyes\r\nSilent sunbeams falling across the window\r\nSuddenly she awakens with surprise\r\nDay and night they always go so quickly\r\nIn TV time...\r\nHer husband rushes in and in the meantime\r\nShe just slightly smiles and turns her head\r\nHe just whispers something to her softly\r\nGod knows what he said...\r\nYou know it wasn't very long\r\nBefore the two of them were kissing\r\nShe was his wife, he was her man\r\nBut they knew what they were missing\r\n\r\nChorus\r\n\r\nTV's on and someone's watching\r\nEyes\r\nThey're getting in through your eyes\r\nDon't let them poison your mind",
