Thanks!\n\n♥Tiffany♥\n\nLyrics and Music:\n© Tiffany Alvord 2008\n\nWhen I was younger\nYou use to say\nThat all of my dreams would \nSoon go away\nBut no matter what you say\nI will always hold on\nTo that dream that I believe in\nCause it makes me so strong\nAnd no matter what you do\nI will never stop \nCause believin in that dream\nIs the thing I've got\n\nAnd my dream \nIs gonna come true\nLike the sun on a cloudy day\nIt's gonna shine through\nAnd My dream \nWill always go on\nEven if it's just inside my heart\nThat's what makes me strong\n\nI know that you could\nNever change\nWhat I want to be \nCause I know that's what makes myself me\nAnd I've always looked up to the sky \nWhen I was feeling down\nBut when I looked into my heart\nThat is where I found\nThe hope I need \nThe faith I want\nThe dream I see free\nAll I have to do now\nIs just to be me\n\nCause my dream \nIs gonna come true\nLike the sun on a cloudy day\nIt's gonna shine through\nAnd My dream \nWill always go on\nEven if it's just inside my heart\nThat's what makes me strong\n\nCause when I'm myself \nI always know\nBetter than anyone else\nThe path that I should go\nAnd I have always known what I want to do\nI just need to believe \nAnd always push through\n\nCause my dream \nIs gonna come true\nLike the sun on a cloudy day\nIt's gonna shine through\nAnd My dream \nWill always go on\nEven if it's just inside my heart\nThat's what makes me strong\n\nCause that's what makes me\nThat's what makes me \nThat's what makes me strong\n\nThe intro and first two verses are:\nEA-EA-EA-EA CF-CF-CF-CF DG-DG-DG-DG BE-BE-BE-BE\nYou play that once for the intro and twice for the beginning of the verse.\nThen it goes into chords which are:\nACE, GBD, FAC, EGC and you repeat those chords until the end of the chorus. For the last note of the chorus the (EGC) isn't played and you go back into playing EAEA.... for the start of the second verse. It is the same as the first verse and then goes into the chorus. Next is the bridge. The chords for this are: \nFAC, EGB, DFA, BDG\nFAC, EGB, EFA, BDG\nEGB, FAC, GBD, ACE\nFAC, GBD\nThen it goes back into the chorus.... the chords are the same til the end of the song. I hope this makes sense and good luck playing it. =D",
