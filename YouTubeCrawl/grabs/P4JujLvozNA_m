This was shown during half-time of the Marshall-UCF game. McConaughey and McG, who were present during this feature, give a speech about the movie in another clip in my collection. Sorry about the shakiness. I was sitting about 150 yards away at a lower level seat with a Canon Powershot digital camera.",
