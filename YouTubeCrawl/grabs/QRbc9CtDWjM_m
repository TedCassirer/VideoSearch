    "description": "How to go through Inky the ghost at the start of the Strawberry (2nd board) on Ms.Pac-Man, and eat all the ghosts & fruit (after having done the same on the 1st board Cherry) for a perfect 29,400, also known as a \"dpnd\" (double perfect, no deaths). For more such definitions, see www.pactionary.com and then click on \"The Pactionary\", some of them are really hilarious :P\r\n\r\nAlso, \"Act I - They Meet\" is shown.\r\n\r\nVid recorded with Quick Screen Recorder, from an online pacman-site whose version is an exact duplicate of this classic 80's arcade-game! :)\r\n\r\nAny Ms.Pac-Man requests? I'll try to record & post vids of it ;) Oh yeh, and sry there's no sound, it wont record sound off my screen for some reason (hey i'm only a videogame-geek, not a computer-whiz :P)... any ideas why? Any1? Plz post!! (pretty-plz with a ms.pacman cherry on top?) ;)",
