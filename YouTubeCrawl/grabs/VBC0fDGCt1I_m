    "description": "This video gives you an inside look at house churches around the world.       \r\nThey are very different from what the typical American visualizes when he thinks about going to church. There's no steeple or church bell.  There may not be any hymns or even Bibles.  Even so, house churches around the world are lively and active in reaching their communities for Christ.",
