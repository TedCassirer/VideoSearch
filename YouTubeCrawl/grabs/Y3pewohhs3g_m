    "description": "- same clip, better quality - \r\n\r\nThis is Jussi Reijonen playing a fretless guitar by Flaxwood featuring a Fernandes Sustainer pickup and Seymour Duncan lipstick and humbucker played over an Elmwood Stinger 30.\r\nRecorded at Frankfurt Musikmesse 2008.\r\n\r\nIt was awefully loud, but note the magic moment when the guitar starts to sing...\r\n\r\nfor more information on the guitars visit http://www.flaxwood.com",
