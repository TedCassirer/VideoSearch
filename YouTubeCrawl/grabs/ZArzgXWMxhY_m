    "description": "Just in time I was able to finish a new vid. The episode \"Utopia\" was overwhelming and gobsmacking and I knew that I had to make a vid to it.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday I was skimming through some songs on my harddrive and then I found a song and the title itself was great (because there is one tiny little scene in the episode which is soooo brilliant *gg*) and when I heard the first few lines of the lyrics I knew that I had found the perfect song for \"Utopia\" *gg*. So here we go.\r\n\r\nI used ONLY scenes from \"Utopia\" and the trailer for \"The Sound of Drums\".\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch and lots of kisses to Maggi for helping me (... again *lol*) with my technical problems. I'd be lost without you *big-hug* :)))\r\n\r\nI hope you like it and I'm looking forward to your comments :))). Enjoy.\r\n\r\nAnd of course:\r\nI don't own any of the material I used. It belongs to the rightful owner. The vid has been made just for fun so I don't make any money out of it.",
