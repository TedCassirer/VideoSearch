Oh! The dark procession is near! \r\n\r\nAt least spare the lives of the youths! -- The tormented mothers cry out; but the massiveness of the procession is already gulping down the flesh of the young ones as well. Oh! The dark procession is here.\r\n\r\nNeither are we save, for we carry our procession inside, our entrails revolt and our muscles tighten to prepare for the great dark procession approaching!",
