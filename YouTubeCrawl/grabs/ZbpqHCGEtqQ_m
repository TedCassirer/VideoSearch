Are you telling me that you don't know where we a...- \r\nVirginia- (cuts off Ashley) Will you guys just shut up? We need to figure out where the rental car is!\r\nMari- She speaks!\r\nVirginia- (rolls eyes and looks down at map of airport) Ugh. Right now I hate mom for making us go to the stupid Camp Waterdog (A.N. first thing that popped into my head lol. Plus it's a real lake near my house.) thing. We have plenty of things to do this summer! Like, shopping and talking about the Jonas Brothers or... I got nothing.\r\nAshley- Ooooh! Lookie here! Chips! (grabs some and stuffs her face) But anyway, doesn't everyone not want to go? No one wants to go there. What do we even do at camp?\r\nMari- I guess we will find out...\r\nVirginia- FINALLY! Found it! (runs over to a red mustang convertible) SA-WEET!! \r\n(Girls hop into car and drive to camp)\r\n\r\n\r\n(On private jet with the Jonas boys)\r\nJoe- I don't want to waste my summer at some camp! (A.N. I've been watching too much Camp Rock! Lol.)\r\nNick- (has fallen asleep and starts to snore)\r\nKevin- It's not all summer! Only for 6 weeks!\r\nMama J- Joseph, don't over dramatize the situation. You need to know what it's like to be normal teenagers. Besides you boys have to leave now to get there on time.\r\nNick- (keeps snoring)\r\nJoe- EW! NICK! WAKE UP! STOP SNORING OR YOU ARE GONNA DROOL!\r\nNick- (half asleep) No! Kangaroo, crayon, JOE! (his hand flies up on accident and collides with Joe's face)\r\nJoe- OWIE! Mommy?\r\nMama J- Yes Joseph?\r\nJoe- Kiss it please.\r\nNick- (FINALLY wakes up fully) What'd I miss?\r\nJoe- (gives Nick death glare) You slapped me with you were asleep.\r\nNick- Oh. You probably deserved it.\r\nJoe- Ugh.\r\nPapa J- Boys! Time to go!\r\nJoe- But I wanna go to Disneyland...\r\nKevin- Lets go!\r\n(The boys hop into a limo and sit there for what seems like an hour and a half. The scenery changes from a city to a dry deserty place to a lush green forest. About a few minutes into the forest the boys see a sign saying 'Camp Waterdog'.\r\nJoe- Oh god. \r\nKevin- Weird name...\r\n(They arrive at a secluded lake much like camp rock. But next to the lake are 6 cabins. Each cabin is divided into 2 parts: Girls and boys. The only thing joining the girls from boys is a small hallway.)\r\nJoe- WHOA! HOTTIES AT 12 O'CLOCK!\r\n(A red mustang convertible suddenly pulls up in front of the limo. Three girls ranging in age but look related come out and look a little bit suspiciously at the limo and the boys but shrug it off. They grab their bags and put them into the seats. Finally the girls walk into a group of campers huddled around a platform.)\r\nJoe- Wow. Our time at camp probably won't be that bad...\r\nNick- (still standing in awe) Yeah...\r\n\r\nSorry it's a little short but it'll work for now. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE COMMENT RATE AND SUBSCRIBE! I will post chapter 2 maybe later otherwise tommorow. I hope you liked it!",
