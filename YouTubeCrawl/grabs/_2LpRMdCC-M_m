    "description": "PointScreen makes it possible to control the computer intuitively with gestures. It is developed at Fraunhofer Institute IAIS (http://www.iais.fraunhofer.de). The user navigates by merely pointing toward the screen; contrary to touch screen technology, the interaction proceeds completely without touch. The technology was developed by the Fraunhofer Institute IAIS.\r\nVolkswagen used the PointScreen technology as Strategy Boards at the IAA 2005 (International Motor Show)in Frankfurt/Main, Germany and at the Motor Show 2006 in Geneve, Switzerland.\r\nMore information is available on the following site:\r\nhtt://www.pointscreen.info",
