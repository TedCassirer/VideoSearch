    "description": "www.egyptiangumbo.com\r\nThis is Sheikh Fahd Al-Kanderi From Masjid Al-Kabeer in Kuwait in salat ul-shaf3 Ramadan 1428. \r\n\r\nHe is reciting in the First Rakah Surah Al-Qadr:\r\n\r\n1 Verily! We have sent it (this Quran) down in the night of Al-Qadr (Decree)  \r\n 2 And what will make you know what the night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is?  \r\n 3 The night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping Allah in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, i.e. 83 years and 4 months).  \r\n 4 Therein descend the angels and the Rooh (Jibrael (Gabriel)) by Allahs Permission with all Decrees,  \r\n 5 Peace! (All that night, there is Peace and Goodness from Allah to His believing slaves) until the appearance of dawn.\r\n\r\nSecond Rakah Is from Surat Al-Ma'oon:\r\n\r\n1 Have you seen him who denies the Recompense?  \r\n 2 That is he who repulses the orphan (harshly),  \r\n 3 And urges not the feeding of AlMiskeen (the poor),  \r\n 4 So woe unto those performers of Salat (prayers) (hypocrites),  \r\n 5 Who delay their Salat (prayer) from their stated fixed times,  \r\n 6 Those who do good deeds only to be seen (of men),  \r\n 7 And refuse Al-Maoon (small kindnesses e.g. salt, sugar, water, etc.).",
