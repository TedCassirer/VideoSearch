The next three are from the \"Hello Maine\" era (circa 1982), before the station's call letters changed.  The next two IDs are from after the call letter switch (circa 1984).  The next three are from 1987, and use a different series of Frank Gari's \"Hello News\" music.  The next is from Earth Day, 1990.  The final ID shows off the weather team from 1991.",
