    "description": "To expand the idea of the \"Ghosts\" project, Nine Inch Nails is inviting anyone and everyone to create visuals to accompany the album's music. In a few months, we'll be gathering the entries we feel are particularly exceptional and highlighting them. There are no rules to this - be as creative as you like. Create a music video, or a short film, or something completely abstract. Use only one track from the album, or use multiple tracks.\r\n\r\nJoin this group and add your video to submit it to the film festival.\r\n\r\nSome tips and guidelines for video submissions:\r\n\r\n- Prepare your content in the highest resolution you can, and hang on to the original files, in case we want to use your video for something beyond the scope of YouTube.\r\n\r\n- This project will be going on for quite a while, so take your time. Please don't just submit simple image slideshows.\r\n\r\n- This isn't a place to submit your musical remixes or vocal performances that don't include any video content - if you have audio-only creations using Ghosts music, please contribute those to http://remix.nin.com\r\n\r\n- Incorporating copyrighted materials (clips from movies, unlicensed stock footage, music by other artists, etc) into your video might limit our ability to feature it in the future. The same goes for filming of people or locations without their permission. Anything goes on YouTube, but we'll have to play by the rules for other outlets, so if you want your video to be eligible for anything we come up with in the future, make sure its content is fully cleared.\r\n\r\n- Clips that are clearly not legitimate festival submissions (i.e. promotional videos for unrelated content with Ghosts music thrown over them) will be discarded.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKSTV.TV STORE \r\nMAKSTVPLUS.COM IPTV (more)",
