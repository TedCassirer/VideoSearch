Join us in a regional gathering of the tribes as we celebrate as one primal force Goa Gil's sonic transmission of cutting-edge psychedelic trance across Deerfields, a 940-acre private retreat in the sacred Appalachian Mountains. Beneath the skies, on earthen soil where nature abounds, we will dance by ritual fire as the ancients once did - guided by Goa Gil in Redefining the Ancient Tribal Ritual for the 21st Century through the Trance Dance Experience! \r\n\r\n\"[We] are coming to these rituals in the same spirit that the ancients came to these rituals to use music and dance to commune with the Cosmic Spirit, the Spirit of Nature, the Spirit which is behind Nature and the Cosmic Mind, and the Cosmic Being which exists within everything... This is getting down with Mother Earth and becoming one with the Spirit through the music and dance, which is as old as mankind itself\" \r\n\r\nGoa Gil (The Nommos, Avatar Records) - Sadhu (Holy Man) • Technoshaman • Father of Goa/Psychedelic Trance\r\n\r\nOpening Ceremony by Sakkred Circle\r\nDeco by Pyite and The Community\r\nSound by Project7\r\nFlyer Design by Iikah\r\n\r\nFriday, May 18th (Night)\r\n· Ritual Bonfire and Guided Drum Circle\r\nInitiate the Trance Dance Experience with collective drumming and tribal dancing!\r\n\r\nSaturday, May 19th (Day)\r\n· Yoga, Chi Gung, and other Workshops - *Detailed schedule available soon\r\n\r\nSaturday, May 19th (Night) and Sunday, May 20th (Day)\r\n· Opening Ceremony by Sakkred Circle\r\n· Goa Gil and Redefining the Ancient Tribal Ritual for the 21st Century \r\n\r\nwww.atlantapsytrance.net\r\nwww.thosepeople-asheville.com",
