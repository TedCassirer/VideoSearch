    "description": "This is from Quay Theatre Arts summer school in Weymouth, Dorset in August 2005. It was a very Fun week full of dancing and singing. There were auditions for solo acts and I got one of them and decided to sing this song as I love the musical \"Chicago\" :) I was 14 when this was taken. Hope you like it :) \r\nlove Mary x",
