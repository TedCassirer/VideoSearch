    "description": "** NEW (Jan/2011) THIS VIDEO HAS BEEN CITED IN AN ACADEMIC ARTICLE (read more below)\r\n\r\nThe link to the article is here: http://tinyurl.com/374xjyt\r\n\r\nTITLE: Democratic Public Discourse in the Coming\r\nAutarchic Communities\r\n\r\nABSTRACT:\r\nThe main purpose of this article is to tackle the problem of living together -- as\r\ndignified human beings -- in a certain territory in the field of social\r\nphilosophy, on the theoretical grounding ensured by some remarkable\r\nexponents of the Austrian School âˆ’ and by means of the praxeologic method.\r\nBecause political tools diminish the human nature not only of those who use\r\nthem, but also of those who undergo their effects, people can live a life worthy\r\nof a human being only as members of some autarchic or self-governing\r\ncommunities. As a spontaneous order, every autarchic community is\r\ninherently democratic, inasmuch as it makes possible free involvement,\r\npeaceful coordination, free expression and the free reproduction of ideas. The\r\nmembers of autarchic communities are moral individuals who avoid\r\naggression, practice self-control, seek a dynamical efficiency and establish\r\n(together with their fellow human beings) a democratic public discourse.\r\n\r\nKeywords: democracy, democratic public discourse, libertarian, self-control,\r\nnon-aggression axiom, spontaneous order, autarchic community\r\n\r\nMETA: RESEARCH IN HERMENEUTICS, PHENOMENOLOGY, AND PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY VOL. II, NO. 2 / 2010: 386-409, ISSN 2067-3655, www.metajournal.org\r\n\r\n----------------------------- *********************************** --------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER MAP:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwsmzHxMktA\r\n\r\nExplore more at http://home.zonnet.nl/gerardvonhebel/\r\n\r\nI just got the pictures they have on their site, added the dates and morphed them in sequence. \r\n\r\nPay special attention to the area that is now called Germany. So much change in so little time.\r\n\r\nMusic: Johannes Brahms - Waltz (1865)\r\n\r\nNote: I am not affiliated with the websites, I just made this out of pure curiosity.",
