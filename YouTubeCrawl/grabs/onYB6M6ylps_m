    "description": "Reactive Party in \"the oven\" in Barcelona/Poble Nou. Institut FATIMA is improvising and using the sounds of the cook Frank Rudow (ex drummer of Manta Ray) while he is cooking chicken with rice on stage. a camera is filming him live and maybe you can see it in the back of the stage on the screen. the sound of the concert was like the dinner tasted afterwards....and it tasted delicious. for more info visit http://myspace.com/institutfatima",
