I need sleep.\r\n\r\nSong: Why Can't I by Liz Phair\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: If Grey's Anatomy belonged to me, i would probably live in USA. I do not. I would also probably be eating something right now, because in USA it's not 2.35 in the morning, and you wouldn't wake everybody up if you wanted to cook. Therefore I do not own Grey's Anatomy. It would have been nice though.",
