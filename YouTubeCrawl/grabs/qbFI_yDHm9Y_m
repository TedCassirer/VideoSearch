    "description": "Senior citizen saved 50 hours after quake\r\nWATCH VIDEO\r\nSource: CCTV.com | 05-16-2008 15:40\r\nSpecial Report:   Strong quake jolts SW China\r\n\r\nIn rescue work, medical expertise based on scientific knowledge is crucial in saving lives and relieving suffering. Amputation is even sometimes necessary as a last resort, especially for injured or trapped survivors of the earthquake. \r\nOn Thursday afternoon, rescue workers discovered a senior citizen amid the rubble of a collapsed structure nearly 50 hours after the quake. After carefully removing debris away from his body and concerns over whether amputation would be necessary to free the man the senior citizen was successfully rescued, without amputating any of his limbs. \r\n\r\nWhen rescuers found the senior citizen, he was extremely weak. One of his legs and one of his arms was caught under the debris and he was not able to dislodge them. \r\n\r\nThe rescuers faced a tough decision. The old man was in danger of dying if they couldn't free him in a timely manner. But the only way they could quickly free him from his entrapment was if they resorted to amputation. \r\nAt this critical moment, more medical experts arrived on the scene. Carefully assessing his health and investigating the rubble that was pressing upon him -- they decided to carefully remove the debris -- instead of resorting to amputation. \r\n\r\nRescue workers feared that the debris might topple upon the old man so they could only use very simple tools to displace the debris around him. \r\n\r\nThe man was finally saved.",
