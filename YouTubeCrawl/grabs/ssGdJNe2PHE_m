    "description": "Click Me---http://goo.gl/3qLdMN\nhttp://kylelandry.com\n\nO_O  \n\nThis may be considered the beast of the final fantasy piano collections by many.  And that is precisely why this is my third time playing this for youtube!  I have been playing this piece since 2006, and each year I improve.  \n\nMy last two attempts were far too rushed, so I tried to play more steady like Seiji Honda did on the CD.  However, there are still sloppy sections, but that is expected because I was still only 18 in this video.  I may redo it sometime.  It has almost been three years, I am due!\n\nYour Pianist Updating,\nKyle Landry\n\n(2-12-11)\n\nHope you enjoy though!\n\nKyle",
