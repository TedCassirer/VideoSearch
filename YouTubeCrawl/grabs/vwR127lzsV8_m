    "description": "Watch the last epsiode to fing out what happened.\n\n*Kevin, Lena, Aly, and Meg sat down in the booth, too afraid to talk to Demi or Nick.*\nDemi: *very quietly and softly* It's okay...you can come out...\n*When they walk out, they see Demi still staring at the wall.*\nLena: *softly* Are you okay Demz?\nDemi: *shudders and shakes*\nLena: Demi? *she walks over and sees Demi crying harder than ever. Tears were pouring down her face. Selena had never seen her cry so hard. Not even when she broke her leg and then her dog bit it while it was broken.*\nDemi: *so quiet, Selena had to strain to listen* I...i have to....i gotta go...\n*Demi walks out, and when she thinks she is out of earshot, she bursts out crying and sobbing. Little does she know that Nick is around the corner*\nDemi: God. I am soooo stupid. Demi...you are such a freakin idiot. I should have told him why... *starts sobbing and shaking uncontrollably. She then curls into a ball and lays there against the wall, sobbing and shaking.*\nNick: (In his mind) Wow. Demi is really upset.\nHe turns the corner and finds Demi just curled up into a ball and shaking so hard, and sobbing. Her mascara and makeup was all over her face and hands. Her shirt was so wet from her tears, and her hair was so discheveled. \nNick: Ohmygod. Demi!\nDemi: *looks up, and cries even harder (if that's possible) as she sees Nick* What? *she said this briefly inbetween sobs*\n*Nick (being the great guy that he is) runs over to Demi, picks her up, and just holds her in his arms.*\nDemi: I...am....soo....soo...sorry. (The dots represent sobs) *she says this as she cries into his shoulder*\nNick: No. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything about you. I was being mean.\nDemi: No. I should've explained why it hurt so much.\nNick: Look. We are both at fault here. Why don't we go to Starbucks and you can tell me why it hurt.\nDemi: Okay.\n*They walk to Starbucks.*\nNick: How about you tell me what you want and you can go get cleaned up.\nDemi: *laughs and wipes her face* Okay. I want a Vanilla Bean Frapuccino with no whip.\nNick: *laughs* Okay.\n*Demi walks away*\n\nWhen she comes back, Nick waves and she walks over.\nNick: Your coffee. *hands it to her*\nDemi: Thank you.\nNick: Okay. So what happened.\nDemi: Well, it all started when I was in 2nd grade. I was in Music class, and we all had to sing. I didn't want to, cuz I didn't know I could sing. I was nervous, and then when I said I didn't want to, the teacher tried to make me, but I flat out said no. She finally said ok. But the rest of the class started calling me uptight, and then everyone has since then. Until last year. People forgot about me. Which, I didn't mind, cuz they wouldn't call me uptight anymore. But, when you called me uptight, I got so mad. I thought that 8th grade was the last of it.\nNick: Oh yeah. Selena said, 'Uh Oh' when Meaghan had told you.\nDemi: Yeah. Lena was the only one that stuck by me. She is really a true friend.\nNick: Seems like. Well, I appreciate you telling me. You do not know how much it hurt when I saw you crying.\nDemi: Yeah. I don't think it was the uptight part, but about how we were fighting.\nNick: Yeah.\nDemi: BTW, why did you just walk out after I asked what I did?\nNick: I hate retard jokes. My uncle is retarded. I don't think there is anything funny about calling someone a retard.\nDemi: I'm sorry.\nNick: It's okay. You didn't know.\nDemi: Yeah. So, no hard feelings?\nNick: Nah.\n*They get up and hug tightly.*\n\nHappy Ending!! YAY!!! Next episode is the first Jemi moment. But not how you think...Hmmm...\n\nComment, rate, subscribe, tell friends.",
