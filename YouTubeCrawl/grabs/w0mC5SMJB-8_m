A full DVD ISO file of the film (with special features and everything) can be downloaded here: http://www.chardhousemedia.co.uk/MT.html\r\n\r\nThis is a trailer I created for the outstanding DOCTOR WHO fan film THE MILLENNIUM TRAP written and directed by Rob Thrush and starring Nick Scovell as the Doctor. This is the same basic creative team that has been responsible for the superb Dalek stage productions in the UK, \"Evil of the Daleks\" in 2006 and \"The Dalek Masterplan\" in 2007. The video was produced in 1997 and is one of the best WHO fan films ever made.",
