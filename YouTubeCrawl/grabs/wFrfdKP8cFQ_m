    "description": "In memory of my loving dad, who passed away on April 4th, 2008. He was one of fourteen children. An incredible man of God, he out lived doctors expectations by nearly 40 years. He lost his left leg just below the knee due to a hunting accident in 1966, and in the meantime was diagnosed with ALS, better know as Lou Gehrig's disease, which he said God healed him of when he got saved. He was told that he would'nt live to see any of his children graduate high school. He was two days shy of 69 years old when he passed. He had 5 children, 6 grand-children, 2 step-grand children, and 5 great-grandchildren. He loved nothing more than his God and his family. He will be missed but certainly never forgotten. I love you, Dad. The song is I Sure Miss You by The Crabb Family. This was by far the hardest video I've ever had to create. Thanks for watching.",
