    "description": "Yesterday was a really interesing day in a lot of ways...I started out by recording some drums for my good friend Niclas Criborn. Doing some pitch experiments and moogerfoogering. Then two friends from Västerås and brought a large synthesizer.com system for me to try out so that I would get a better understanding of how they work as I have been curious about them for years. \r\n\r\nSadly enough the experience left me impressed, inspired and utterly confused.\r\n\r\nSo to round off the day I thought I could make some standard films of pedals trying to show and demonstrate a bit how they work. Usually when people do this they use a drum machine or a arpggiated synth so I thought that maybe I could do something a bit different...so I recorded a little loop into a Boss loopstation of the Mellotron MK II strings and then tried that through a bunch of pedals.\r\n \r\nThis film was shot at the Roth Händle studios in stockholm with a simple Nokia phone. The studio is filled with odd and interesting instruments including Mellotrons, optigans and piles of other analog goodies. If you are curious about the studio please take a stroll by www.roth-handle.nu",
