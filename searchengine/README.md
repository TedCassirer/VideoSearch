# The search engine

## Web version

The web search engine is a heroku app. So if you want to test it you need both
**heroku** and **maven** on your machine (and Java 8 as well).

To run it locally you only need to run `heroku local web` or just `heroku
local` in the `searchengine/` directory.  The search engine is then accessible
at: `localhost:5000`.
